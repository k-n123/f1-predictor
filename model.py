        # 2. Predicting fastest lap/winning driver from practice sessions, tires, historical data, track type and weather

            Goals:
            A lap time simulator that takes tire, fuel, and temperature as inputs
            A driver comparison dashboard showing pace differences over time
            A strategy simulator to predict pit stop timings
            A race replay analyzer with predicted vs actual outcomes
